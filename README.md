# Customer Segmentation Analysis - SQL & Power BI

### Objective:  
To segment customers based on purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and help businesses tailor marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and customer engagement initiatives based on customer value and lifecycle stage.

### Tools Used:  
SQL, Power BI

### Data Source:  
A fictional e-commerce dataset containing customer transactions, sales amount, frequency of purchases, and state-wise customer details over multiple years.

### Key Features:  
- RFM scores were calculated in **SQL** using transaction history to classify customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value  
- Connected the RFM-segmented dataset to **Power BI** for further analysis, visualization, and dashboard design  
- Developed an interactive dashboard with a **treemap** to visually represent customer segments (e.g., Champions, Loyal, At Risk, Lost)  
- Built KPIs to display **Total Sales**, **Total Customers**, and **Total Profit** for quick business performance overview  
- Created a searchable customer-level table showing **Recency (days since last purchase)**, **Purchase Frequency**, and **Monetary Value**  
- Designed a **bar chart by state** to show customer distribution across key regions  
- Integrated **year slicers** for dynamic time-based customer analysis

### Insights Derived:  
- The largest customer segments are **At Risk (14.75%)** and **Potential Loyalists (14.38%)**, highlighting key re-engagement opportunities  
- **Champions (10.34%)** and **Loyal customers (9.96%)** represent high-value segments ideal for upselling and referral initiatives  
- **California**, **New York**, and **Texas** host the most customers, making them strategic locations for regional marketing  
- Segments like **Cannot Lose Them (2.52%)** and **About To Sleep (4.79%)** signal disengagement and the need for targeted recovery campaigns

### Outcome/Value:  
This dashboard enables marketing and sales teams to take **data-driven actions** by identifying customer lifecycle stages, improving targeting, increasing retention, and maximizing customer lifetime value. The use of SQL for scoring ensures accuracy and repeatability in segmentation across future datasets.
