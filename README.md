# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
In this project, I performed a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to categorize customers based on their purchasing behaviors. The analysis was conducted using SQL to handle large datasets and derive meaningful insights.

RFM Analysis with SQL: Extracted and cleaned customer transaction data. Calculated recency, frequency, and monetary values for each customer. Segmented customers into distinct groups based on RFM scores to identify high-value and at-risk customers.

Data Visualization with Power BI: Connected Power BI to the SQL database for seamless data integration. Created interactive dashboards to visualize RFM segments, enabling easy interpretation of customer segments. Highlighted key insights and trends to aid in strategic decision-making.

Outcome: Identified high-value customers for targeted marketing campaigns. Recognized at-risk customers, enabling proactive engagement strategies. Provided actionable insights to enhance customer retention and maximize revenue.
